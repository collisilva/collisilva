Hi, 
 
I'm Matheus Colli Silva (@mcollisilva) and this is my personal GitHub account.

I'm interested in biology, informatics, nature, swimming and exploring the world facetes. 

I'm a Brazilian researcher @ University of SÃ£o Paulo, studying plant systematics and biogeography, and I'm currently learning data science towards improving biodiversity studies.

You can reach me at matheus.colli.silva@alumni.usp.br, I'll be happy to help, learn & collaborate.

cheers
